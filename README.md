# PyTorch for High School Students

This repository contains notebooks and resources to help high school students learn the basics of PyTorch and build simple neural networks.

## Contents

1. **Basic Python Concepts for High School Students**: A notebook that covers the basics of Python programming, including variables, loops, lists, functions, and an introduction to NumPy.
2. **PyTorch and Simple Neural Networks**: A notebook that introduces PyTorch and walks through building and training a simple neural network.
3. **Detailed Explanations**: A notebook with detailed explanations for each line of code in the PyTorch example, providing a deeper understanding of how neural networks and PyTorch work.

## How to Use

### Running Locally
If you'd like to run these notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NedaTavakoli/PyTorch_for_High_School_Students/tree/main.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Running in Google Colab
You can also run the notebooks on Google Colab. The links to open each notebook in Colab are provided inside the notebooks themselves. To use Google Colab, you will need a Gmail account.

## Topics Covered

- **Tensors**: Learn about PyTorch tensors and how they are used for computations.
- **Neural Networks**: Build a simple feedforward neural network.
- **Training Loops**: Understand how to train a neural network with backpropagation, loss functions, and optimizers.
- **Python Basics**: If you're new to Python, the `Basic_Python_for_High_School_Students` notebook will guide you through the essential programming concepts.
